# Inception

Inception is a deep learning project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It focuses on implementing and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The project provides a hands-on experience in deep learning, including model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

The main objective of Inception is to gain practical knowledge of deep learning concepts and techniques, specifically in the field of image classification. By building and training CNN models, students explore the fundamentals of deep neural networks and develop skills in working with large-scale image datasets.

## Key Features:

- Convolutional neural networks: Inception involves implementing CNN architectures, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, to extract features and classify images.
- Model architecture design: The project focuses on designing efficient and effective network architectures, considering factors such as model depth, width, and connectivity patterns.
- Training and optimization: Inception incorporates techniques for training neural networks, including backpropagation, gradient descent optimization, and regularization methods.
- Data preprocessing: The project involves preprocessing image data, such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to enhance model performance and generalization.
- Evaluation and analysis: Inception includes evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and conducting analysis to understand model behavior and identify areas of improvement.

*By working on Inception, you will gain practical experience in deep learning, understanding the inner workings of convolutional neural networks and their application to image classification tasks. It provides a foundation for further exploration of advanced deep learning techniques and applications.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a comprehensive deep learning framework.
