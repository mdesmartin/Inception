# Inception

Inception is a project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum, focused on creating and managing multi-service applications using Docker. It involves building a robust and scalable environment where various services, such as web servers, databases, and application servers, can be containerized and orchestrated.

The main objective of Inception is to provide hands-on experience in using Docker and Docker Compose to create, configure, and manage containers. The project emphasizes the principles of containerization, service isolation, and network management in a multi-service application context.

## Key Features:

- Docker Containers: Inception involves creating Docker containers for different services, ensuring isolation and efficient resource management.
- Docker Compose: The project uses Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications, facilitating easier configuration and orchestration.
- Service Orchestration: Inception focuses on orchestrating multiple services, ensuring they can communicate effectively and operate as a cohesive system.
- Environment Configuration: The project emphasizes configuring the environment for different services, including setting up networks, volumes, and environment variables.
- Scalability and Robustness: Inception provides an opportunity to design and implement scalable and robust multi-service architectures using Docker.

*By working on Inception, you will gain practical experience in containerization, service orchestration, and environment configuration. It offers insights into building and managing scalable multi-service applications using modern DevOps practices.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a production-grade solution for multi-service application management.
